# Movie Marketplace Web App

A dynamic movie marketplace built using React, TMDB API, Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and other modern libraries. Users can browse popular movies and TV shows, view detailed pages with real‑time simulated stock prices, and perform buy/sell transactions—all while enjoying a responsive, dark-themed UI.

## Overview

The Movie Marketplace Web App (also known as MovieHub) offers an engaging interface where users can:
- Browse popular movies and TV shows (fetched from the TMDB API)
- View detailed information for each movie/TV show
- See real-time stock price simulations, where movie/TV show “prices” update dynamically every few seconds
- Buy and sell virtual movie stocks, with portfolio tracking and live price updates  
The project features a dark, modern, and responsive UI with custom animations and gradients for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Hero Banner:** A full-width hero section that displays a trending movie with a gradient overlay and call-to-action.
- **Dynamic Listings:** Grids for popular movies and TV shows that update in real time with dynamic pricing.
- **Detail Pages:** Separate detail views for movies and TV shows with extended information, real-time price updates, and trading (buy/sell) functionality.
- **Real-Time Price Simulation:** Stock price simulation using a custom algorithm with Zustand, updating every 2 seconds.
- **Buy/Sell Transactions:** Users can purchase and sell virtual movie stocks while tracking their overall portfolio.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly search for any movie or TV show with the results displayed in an interactive dropdown.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
- **Error Handling:** Error boundaries and loading states for improved stability and user feedback.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-marketplace-app.git
   cd movie-marketplace-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   _Note: Make sure Node.js and npm are installed._

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the default Vite port).

## Challenges and Thought Process

- **Dynamic Pricing:**  
  We needed to simulate stock price changes in real time. Using Zustand and a setInterval loop, we built a price simulation service. The challenge was ensuring the price state was consistent across different components (home page, details page) and for both movies and TV shows. We solved this by using a persist middleware in Zustand to store price information and updating the UI continuously.

- **API Integration:**  
  Integrating the TMDB API to fetch popular movies, TV shows, trending content, and details came with its own challenges (like handling missing data or APIs returning different field names). We created an abstraction in `api.js`, mapping and formatting the data appropriately.

- **Responsive UI and UX:**  
  Ensuring the dark-themed UI looked great on all devices required careful planning with Tailwind CSS. We adjusted grid layouts, images, and gradient overlays for a modern look.  
  Additionally, error boundaries and loading states were implemented to improve user feedback during network delays or errors.

- **Trading Functionality:**  
  Building the buy/sell functionality with a real-time updating price posed challenges in synchronizing state and ensuring that interactions (like changing quantity) worked across different pages. We managed this by carefully wiring up our global stock store for portfolio management and clear state updates on each transaction.

## Usage

- **Browse and Explore:**  
  On the home page, users can see a hero banner with trending content, scroll through the popular movies and TV shows, and use the search bar to find specific titles.

- **Detailed Views:**  
  Clicking on an item brings the user to a details page where they can see extensive information, dynamic pricing, and trading options.

- **Trading Simulation:**  
  Users can buy or sell stocks using the provided buttons. The app simulates price changes in real time, ensuring that trading interactions feel dynamic and engaging.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Trading Analytics:** Implement charts for historical price data.
- **User Authentication:** Allow users to register/login and persist portfolio across sessions.
- **Improved Search:** Refine the search functionality to include more filtering options.
- **Backend Integration:** Integrate a backend service for real-time trading data and transaction history.
- **Optimized Performance:** Improve state management and interval management for even smoother updates.
